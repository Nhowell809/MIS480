# MIS480: Module 8: Option #1: Capstone Project -- Business Intelligence Solutions for U.S. Organization

### Motivation:

For my Capstone Project I wanted to create a product that would have real world benefit. So, I selected a fleet analysis for the company that I worked for.
The overall goal was to create an algorithm to predict when each company truck would reach 200,000 miles, which appeared to be on the higher side of a trucks
anticipated life expectancy. According to an iSeeCars study, 2.8% and 2.4% of Toyota Tocoma's and Ford F-150's respectively, have over 200,000 miles, when
compared to vehicles across their segment (Blackley, 2022). These percentages represent that the mentioned trucks are twice as likely to reach 200,000 miles, 
when compared to the other vehicles used in the analysis (Blackley, 2022). Addons to my project that I plan to complete in the future include:

* More efficient code (ie. loops with dataframes) 
* Addition of predictive dates for maintenance/service of vehicles to aid in scheduling and substitute truck coordination
* Creation of a dashboard

### Limitations:

Throughout the creation of this project, I have identified a few limitations that hinder the performance of the algorythm. The company I work for does not utilize
a database for tracking/maintaining the mileage for each truck. All data was collected manually and inputted by myself over a three or four day period. Due to time
constraints and the lack of database I only procured six months worth of mileage data, which limits the overall accuracy of the algorithm and its predictive abilities.
Not to mention the possibility of human error in manually entering 1500+ data points. In addition to manually entering the data, there were a multitude of missing 
or not submitted mileage reports -- presenting incomplete data. I used imputation to fill in those missing data points.
